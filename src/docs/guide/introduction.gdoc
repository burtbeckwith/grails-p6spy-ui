The P6Spy UI plugin uses the [P6Spy|https://github.com/p6spy/p6spy] library to intercept JDBC calls and display them in a web page. One benefit of P6Spy is that it will display the SQL that was actually run with SQL ? placeholders but also the SQL with the actual values.

{info}
Note that the plugin does not require the use of the Grails [p6spy|http://grails.org/plugin/p6spy] plugin and is actually incompatible with it. If you are currently using it, migrate your settings from spy.properties to Config.groovy as described in the configuration section and uninstall it.
{info}

The plugin includes with a controller and a GSP that will display the executed SQL in a DataTable, and also graphs in a second tab. Once the plugin is installed navigate to [http://localhost:8080/appname/p6spy|http://localhost:8080/appname/p6spy] to view the queries and graphs, or [http://localhost:8080/appname/p6spy/admin|http://localhost:8080/appname/p6spy/admin] for a basic page displaying configuration settings.
